# Blog Post Style Guide

This guide defines the **standard structure, formatting, and citation conventions** for all blog posts in this repository. It is a living document—feel free to update it as the blog evolves.
---
## 1️⃣ Front‑matter (YAML block)
Every post lives under `src/pages/posts/*.md` and must start with a front‑matter block that Astro can read.
```yaml
---
layout: ../../layouts/BlogPost.astro   # always use this relative path
title: "Your Post Title – Subtitle"
description: "A concise, SEO‑friendly description (max 160 characters)."
pubDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"               # ISO date format; keep it consistent with the actual publish date
---
```
* **layout** – always point to `../../layouts/BlogPost.astro`.
* **title** – capitalize like a headline; include any key phrase you want indexed.
* **description** – a short summary used for the meta description tag.
* **pubDate** – a valid date string (e.g., `2025-12-18`).

## 2️⃣ Recommended Article Structure
Use this skeleton as a starting point. Adjust headings only if the topic truly requires a different flow.
```
## Executive Summary
## 1. Background / Context
### 1.1 Legislative or regulatory framework (if applicable)
### 1.2 Recent updates or events
### 1.3 Relevant executive orders or policy statements
## 2. Key Drivers / Underlying Factors
| Driver | Evidence & Sources |
|--------|--------------------|
## 3. Implications / Impact Analysis
### 3.1 Short‑term outlook (next 12‑24 months)
### 3.2 Medium‑term outlook (2‑5 years)
### 3.3 Risks & Counter‑forces
## 4. Strategic Outlook / Future Considerations
## 5. Conclusion
---
**Sources** (numbered or bulleted list with full URLs, each on its own line)
```
### Section purpose overview
| Section | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Executive Summary** | One‑paragraph snapshot of the whole story – what happened, why it matters, and a high‑level implication. |
| **Background / Context** | Legal, regulatory or historical context; use sub‑headings for clarity. |
| **Key Drivers** | Bullet‑point drivers (e.g., industrial demand, supply constraints, geopolitics). Present data in a markdown table when you have a “driver → evidence” mapping. |
| **Implications / Impact Analysis** | Separate short‑term and medium‑term outlooks; include price ranges, market dynamics, or other relevant metrics. |
| **Strategic Outlook** | Non‑price considerations (policy incentives, recycling programs, international coordination, etc.). |
| **Conclusion** | Recap the main takeaway, future watch‑points, and a call‑to‑action for readers. |
```

## 3️⃣ Citation & Source Formatting
* Cite sources **inline** using markdown link syntax: `[source description](https://example.com)`.
* When you reference a source in a table or bullet list, place the same hyperlink after the description.
* At the end of the article include a **“Sources”** section with a numbered or bulleted list. Each entry must contain:
  * Author/organization (if obvious)
  * Title of the document
  * Publication date (year is enough if exact day isn’t known)
  * Full URL – do not use shortened URLs.
* Example entry:
```
1. USGS, *2025 Draft List of Critical Minerals*, Federal Register (Nov 6 2025) – https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-11-06/pdf/2025‑16311.pdf
```
---
## 4️⃣ AI‑Generated Disclaimer
Because the blog is produced by an AI model, every post must contain a clear disclaimer right after the executive summary (or at the top of the article if you prefer). Use this exact wording:
> **Disclaimer:** This post was generated by an AI language model. It is intended for informational purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.
* Keep it in block‑quote (`>`), bold the word *Disclaimer*, and place a line break before the next section.
---
## 5️⃣ Visuals & Media
* **Images** – store them under `public/` (e.g., `public/chart.png`). Reference with an absolute path: `<img src="/chart.png" alt="Chart description" class="w-full rounded-lg">`.
* **Tables** – use markdown tables for data. Keep column headers short and align columns with `|---|` syntax.
* **Code blocks** – not typical for market analysis, but if needed wrap them in triple backticks with a language hint (e.g., ````bash`).
---
## 6️⃣ Writing Tone & Voice
* Professional yet conversational. Avoid first‑person pronouns like *I* or *we*; write from an objective standpoint.
* Use **active voice** and keep sentences concise (≤ 20 words when possible).
* When mentioning numbers, include units and commas for readability (e.g., `1,200 oz`).
---
## 7️⃣ Review Checklist (before committing)
- [ ] Front‑matter present & correct.
- [ ] All required sections exist in the proper order.
- [ ] Inline citations are present wherever data or quotes appear.
- [ ] A complete “Sources” list with live URLs is at the bottom.
- [ ] AI disclaimer block‑quote is included.
- [ ] No broken markdown syntax (run `npm run build` locally to verify).
- [ ] Images referenced exist in `public/` and have descriptive alt text.
---
## 8️⃣ Future Refinements
* Add a section on **SEO best practices** (meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Card) once the blog gains traffic.
* Create a template `.md` file (`post_template.md`) that pre‑populates the front‑matter and skeleton headings for quick authoring.
* Consider adding a **custom tag system** (e.g., `tags: [economics, policy]`) in the front‑matter to enable tag‑based navigation later.
