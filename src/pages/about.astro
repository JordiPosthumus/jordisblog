          This is where I blog about anything and everything that interests me. 
          If you take any of it seriously, <strong>you are insane</strong>.

            Hi, I'm Jordi. I write about random stuff that catches my attention - sometimes finance, 
            sometimes technology, occasionally something completely unrelated like why cats think they're 
            the rulers of everything. The only guarantee here is that if you use any of my advice for 
            anything important, you'll probably regret it.

            <p class="text-red-800">
              Deep dives into whatever topic caught my fancy this week. 
              Could be markets, could be memes, could be the existential crisis of why we have to click "I agree" on everything.

            <p class="text-blue-800">
              Occasional posts about programming, AI-generated art (like these silly images), 
              and other tech things that make me feel slightly less lost in the modern world.

            <p class="text-green-800">
              Why does toast always land butter-side down? How much is a reasonable amount 
              to spend on domain names for ideas you'll never use? These and other burning questions.

          <h3>AI Generated Silver Price Analysis - Dec 2025</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The blog's first actual "serious" post - apparently I made a whole website just to write about silver prices. 
            It includes weird charts and even weirder AI-generated images of confused animals doing financial analysis.
