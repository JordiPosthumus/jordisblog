## TL;DR – Coverage Ratio in a Nutshell

| Concept | What it measures | Typical market implication |
|---------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Open Interest (OI)** | Total number of outstanding futures contracts (each = 5 000 oz for COMEX silver). | The *potential* amount of metal that could have to be delivered when the contracts expire. |
| **Physical coverage** | How many ounces of that OI are already “assigned” to real silver sitting in CME‑approved warehouses. | Those contracts can’t be rolled without moving the actual metal. |
| **Coverage ratio** = Physical coverage ÷ OI (expressed as %). | The *percentage* of contracts that are already backed by physical metal. | A high number means a lot of the market is “locked‑in” to real silver; a low number means most contracts are purely speculative. |

### Why a **low** coverage ratio does *not* automatically mean “price will go up because there isn’t enough silver”

- **Low coverage = plenty of “paper” that can be closed/rolled without moving metal**, so delivery pressure is low.
- Price moves are driven primarily by **actual inventories, demand outlook, cost‑of‑carry and net positioning**. A tight inventory *can* push spot up, but the premium (futures‑physical divergence) stays modest when most contracts are uncovered because traders can unwind them easily.

### Why a **high** coverage ratio matters

- When > 60 % of OI is already tied to real silver, any short side that wants to stay in the market must either **obtain physical metal**, **borrow it**, or **close before expiry**. This creates a delivery bottleneck.
- The bottleneck adds an extra **premium on futures** (often 15‑25 % above spot) on top of normal cost‑of‑carry, because participants are willing to pay for the right to receive scarce metal at expiry.

### Quick sanity‑check checklist

| Question | What to look for |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Is inventory falling?** | Yes → spot pressure upward. |
| **Is coverage ratio high?** | Yes → delivery pressure adds a premium on top of any spot move. |
| **Is coverage ratio low?** | No delivery bottleneck; premium component likely small, even if spot rises. |
| **What’s the net OI bias (long vs short)?** | Predominantly uncovered shorts often signal bearish sentiment despite low inventories. |

### Bottom line
- **Coverage ratio ≠ scarcity.** It tells you *how many contracts already have real silver attached*.
- Only when **low inventory** and **high coverage** coincide do we see the classic “futures‑physical divergence” with a strong premium.
- To gauge price direction, consider **both** inventory levels **and** coverage ratio, plus demand outlook and cost‑of‑carry.
