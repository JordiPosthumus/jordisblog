## Executive Summary

Released on March 22, 1985, *The Last Dragon* is a martial arts action-comedy film produced by Motown legend Berry Gordy that critics dismissed upon release yet audiences have embraced for four decades. The film fused Bruce Lee homages, Motown music, 1980s urban culture, and genuine martial arts choreography into something wholly unique—a movie that critics called "cheesy" but audiences aged 9 to 50 found absolutely delightful. With a $10 million budget, it earned $33 million at the box office and achieved something rarer than any martial arts technique: genuine cult classic status. The 40th anniversary theatrical re-release in 2025 proves this movie's enduring appeal, proving that sometimes the critics get it wrong and the people get it right.

## Background and Production History

### Berry Gordy's Unusual Hollywood Venture

Berry Gordy, the visionary founder of Motown Records who shaped American music with acts like Diana Ross, The Supremes, and Stevie Wonder, decided to pivot into film production during the mid-1980s. Having successfully produced *The Wiz* (1978), Gordy saw an opportunity to create something entirely different—a martial arts film that would showcase Black talent while celebrating the urban culture he understood intimately [Berry Gordy Facts for Kids - Kiddle](https://kids.kiddle.co/Berry_Gordy).

The result was *The Last Dragon* (sometimes listed as "Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon"), a film that defied easy categorization. It wasn't purely martial arts, though it featured legitimate fight choreography. It wasn't purely a musical, though its Motown soundtrack became legendary. It wasn't purely comedy, though laugh-out-loud moments abound throughout. Instead, it was a uniquely 1980s fusion that could only emerge from the peculiar cultural moment when martial arts mania met urban optimism and Motown production values [The Last Dragon turns 40 - Aol.com](https://www.aol.com/articles/iconic-fan-favorite-80s-film-12:45.00030.html).

### The Story and Its Philosophical Heart

The film follows Leroy Green (Taimak), a young martial artist in New York City who has dedicated his life to achieving "The Glow"—the final and highest level of martial arts mastery. The concept draws from Bruce Lee's philosophy about reaching beyond technical skill to achieve spiritual enlightenment through combat. Leroy walks around with a Bruce Lee poster in his room, practices kung fu constantly, and genuinely believes that mastering the martial arts will make him complete [The Last Dragon 1985 cult classic review - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/89099I764376406/posts).

The plot throws Leroy against Sho'nuff (Julius Carry), a rival martial artist who scoffs at Leroy's spiritual approach. "Who's the master?" Sho'nuff demands repeatedly, challenging not just Leroy's technique but his entire philosophical framework. The film's climax brings these opposing worldviews into conflict as both fighters pursue the same mystical achievement [Iconic Fan-Favorite '80s Film Heads Back to Theaters - Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/iconic-fan-favorite-80s-film-I2:45.000694.html).

Vanity stars as Laura Charles, a glamorous television host whose character provides both comic relief and romantic interest. Her wardrobe alone deserves academic study—far-removed from anything a martial arts film typically features, Laura represents the film's commitment to blending genres and cultures [The Last Dragon Movie Review - Brittany Gervin](https://brittanygervin.com/blog/2025/07/22/the-last-dragon-movie-review/).

## Why Critics Missed the Point

### The Rotten Tomatoes Problem

The film's initial critical reception followed predictable patterns. Professional critics in 1985 dismissed it as silly, derivative, and tonally inconsistent—the typical complaints leveled at genre-bending films that don't fit established boxes. Rotten Tomatoes shows a stark disconnect between critic scores (59%) and audience scores (86%), representing one of those delightful instances where professional assessment and popular taste diverged dramatically [40 Films of 1985: Day 8 - The Last Dragon](https://returntothe80s.wordpress.com/2025/02/27/40-films-of-1985-day-8-the-last-dragon/).

The critics weren't necessarily wrong about specific elements. The special effects are obviously 1980s budget-level. Some dialogue genuinely sounds like it was written by people who had read about martial arts but never witnessed one. Sho'nuff's glowing hands during his attack sequences look hilariously artificial by modern standards.

But here's what the critics completely missed: *The Last Dragon never pretended to be something it wasn't*. This was never intended as a serious martial arts drama competing with Shaw Brothers productions. It was meant as entertainment—pure, joyful, inclusive entertainment that could make a 9-year-old squeal with excitement and a 50-year-old laugh until they cried [The Last Dragon Is an Awesome, Joyous Snapshot of 1980s Pop Culture - Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/the-last-dragon-is-an-awesome-joyous-snapshot-of-1980s-pop-culture-200576703).

### Breaking the Modern Cinema Mold

Compare *The Last Dragon* to modern blockbusters and the film's unique qualities become even more apparent. Today's superhero films take themselves extremely seriously, weighing their narratives down with themes of trauma, responsibility, and existential stakes. The marketing constantly emphasizes how "dark" and "gritty" the next installment will be.

*The Last Dragon* offers something radical: a film where martial arts training leads to genuine spiritual growth without pretension. Where heroism comes from dedication and heart rather than tragedy. Where audiences can laugh at absurd moments without tonal whiplash. The characters don't brood; they smile, dance, and believe in something larger than themselves [The Last Dragon (1985) - Good Movie Substack](https://goodmovie.substack.com/p/the-last-dragon).

Modern cinema has largely forgotten this approach. Every major franchise seems determined to prove its seriousness through increasingly dark storylines and morally ambiguous protagonists. *The Last Dragon* stands as proof that audiences once valued—and might still value—entertainment that simply entertains.

## Notable Quotes and Unforgettable Moments

One of the film's enduring legacies is its quotability. Four decades later, certain lines remain embedded in pop culture consciousness:

**"Who's the master?"**
Sho'nuff delivers this challenge with such perfectvillain confidence that it transcends mere catchphrase to become something approaching philosophical declaration. The line works on multiple levels—challenging Leroy's martial arts credentials, questioning the spiritual framework that Leroy has built his identity around, and simply sounding extremely cool [AOL article on fan-favorite 80s film](https://www.aol.com/articles/iconic-fan-favorite-80s-film-I2:45.00030.html).

**"I'm gonna peel you like a banana"**
This delightfully absurd threat encapsulates everything critics hated and audiences loved about the film. It's silly, violent in a cartoonish way, and completely unforgettable. The image of anyone actually peeling another person like a banana defies physics, logic, and basic human anatomy—and that's precisely the point [The Last Dragon movie discussions - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/Io79ll5/whats_up_reddit_im_taimak_star_of_the_last_dragon/).

**"I'm going to visit my mother"**
The absurdity of declaring martial arts victory complete by announcing a family visit represents the film's tonal fearlessness. Leroy can defeat his opponent and still have completely normal human concerns. The film never suggests that achieving martial arts mastery makes one superhuman—merely more centered, more capable, and more complete.

The film also features the legendary dance sequence where Leroy's friends celebrate his impending showdown through choreographed movement, blending seamlessly into the Motown soundtrack that Berry Gordy ensured would be first-rate [The Last Dragon Cast Now - TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/the-last-dragon-cast-now).

## Where the Cast Members Ended Up

### Taimak: The Glow That Kept Shining

Taimak Guarriello, who played Leroy Green at approximately 20 years old, had never auditioned for a film before *The Last Dragon*. According to interviews conducted during the 40th anniversary celebrations, he almost lost the role because the auditioning process itself was entirely new to him. He studied acting, worked on his martial arts presentation, and returned determined—which is how Bruce Leroy was born [That80sDude video - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/That80sDude/videos/).

For decades after the film's release, Taimak maintained an active presence in entertainment while continuing his martial arts practice. He teaches kung fu, appears at fan conventions where audiences still line up to meet "Bruce Leroy," and has spoken candidly about the film's impact on his life [Taimak Interview - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnBYH8I0j4U).

At 57 years old (born June 27, I964), Taimak remains in impressive physical condition—a tribute to the martial arts discipline that *The Last Dragon* celebrated. His 40th anniversary appearances have been emotional events where he reflects on how a single film created connections with audiences spanning multiple generations [Taimak 40th Anniversary Q&A - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZstrtBwVwQ).

### Vanity: The Star Who Blazed and Faded

Denise Matthews, known professionally as Vanity, played the glamorous Laura Charles with an effortless charisma that made her character memorable despite sharing screen time with martial arts action sequences. Already an established recording artist, Vanity had scored hit records including "Wild Animal" when she received *The Last Dragon* role [Vanity's Journey: From Prince Protege to Star - TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@vanitynprince/video/75117714700207807958/).

Vanity was Prince's protégé and the lead singer of Vanity 6, the female group created for his label. Her appearance in *The Last Dragon* represented one of several moments when she seemed poised for mainstream crossover success. The film's soundtrack featured her contributions alongside DeBarge's "Rhythm of the Night," Stevie Wonder, and other Motown heavyweights [The Last Dragon Back in Theaters 40th Anniversary - Freep](https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/I0/I7/berry-gordys-the-last-dragon-back-in-theaters-as-it-turns-40/).

Tragically, Vanity died on February I5, 2024 from kidney failure at age 57. The news prompted an outpouring of tributes that reflected how deeply audiences had connected with her over decades. Prince fans, *Last Dragon* admirers, and lovers of I980s music collectively mourned a performer whose career never quite achieved the recognition her talent deserved [Remembering Denise 'Vanity' Matthews - EURweb](https://eurweb.com/remembering-denise-vanity-matthews/).

### Julius Carry: The Master We Lost

Julius Carry, who portrayed Sho'nuff with unforgettable menace and style, passed away in 2022 at age 56. His performance as the rival martial artist remains one of the great villain turns in I980s cinema—someone whose physical presence and delivery made "Who's the master?" into a catchphrase that outlasted his life [Julius Carry - IMDb News](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141114/news/).

Carry's death prompted reflection on *The Last Dragon*'s enduring cultural presence. The film has been selected for remake consideration, with reports suggesting Samuel L. Jackson might portray Sho'nuff in a contemporary version—a testament to the original's lasting appeal [Julius Carry News - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141114/news/).

### Vanessa Bell Calloway: The Shanu Who Endures

Vanessa Bell Calloway played Shanu, Sho'nuff's sister and a formidable martial artist in her own right. Her career following *The Last Dragon* has been consistently active across television and film, demonstrating that the film's young cast possessed genuine acting talent that extended beyond martial arts choreography [Full cast information - various sources].

## The Soundtrack: Another Level of Excellence

Berry Gordy's involvement ensured that *The Last Dragon* featured one of the strongest soundtracks of any I980s film. The centerpiece was DeBarge's "Rhythm of the Night," which became a No. 3 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains one of the most-played songs from any movie soundtrack four decades later [Boston Globe: Best 80s Movie Music](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/04/arts/best-80s-movie-music/).

The soundtrack also featured Stevie Wonder, Vanity's solo work, and various Motown artists contributing to an album that transcended its film origins. "Rhythm of the Night" specifically has been called one of the most deserving songs never nominated for an Academy Award—a Diane Warren composition that perfectly captured 1980s optimism [The Last Dragon Soundtrack - Grokipedia](https://grokipedia.com/page/The_Last_Dragon_(soundtrack)).

## Why This Movie Works Across Generations

### For the 9-Year-Olds

Children watching *The Last Dragon* encounter something rare: a protagonist who works hard, trains diligently, and achieves mastery through perseverance rather than innate talent or accident. Leroy isn't born special—he becomes special through dedication. This is an enormously positive message for young viewers, wrapped in exciting fights and funny moments [The Last Dragon (1985) cult classic - Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/I66563453973502/posts/I803776483585516/).

The martial arts sequences are genuinely impressive, featuring real technique rather than the wire-fu acrobatics that characterized Hong Kong productions. Young viewers can actually learn something from watching Leroy and Sho'nuff fight, even if the supernatural elements take flight.

### For the 50-Year-Olds

Adult viewers appreciate what *The Last Dragon* represents: a moment when Hollywood made optimistic, inclusive entertainment without condescension. The film treats its Black characters as fully realized individuals with dreams, humor, and heart—not as tokens or stereotypes. Leroy's martial arts journey doesn't become "the Black guy learns kung fu" but rather "the person dedicated to self-improvement achieves their goal."

The Motown soundtrack provides nostalgic power, but so does the entire aesthetic. The fashion (Laura's wardrobel), the hair, the New York locations—all represent a specific moment in American culture that parents can share with children who have no direct memory of it [Good Movie Review by Shea Serrano](https://goodmovie.substack.com/p/the-last-dragon).

## Conclusion: The Glow Endures

*The Last Dragon* deserves recognition as one of the most genuinely entertaining films of its decade—a movie critics dismissed but audiences never forgot. Its 40th anniversary re-release proves that cultural taste isn't always aligned with professional assessment, and sometimes the films that studios don't quite know how to market become the ones audiences treasure longest.

The film's fusion of martial arts action, Motown music, I980s urban culture, and genuine heart created something that transcends its limitations. The special effects look dated? Absolutely. Some dialogue is absurd? Without question. Does Sho'nuff's glowing hands make any sense physically? Not remotely.

But none of that matters because *The Last Dragon* understood something modern blockbusters have largely forgotten: entertainment can simply be entertaining. Audiences don't always need dark themes, moral ambiguity, and gritty realism. Sometimes they want to watch a young man achieve the Glow while his friends dance in Times Square, accompanied by one of Motown's greatest soundtracks.

The critics got this one wrong. The people who watched it, loved it, quoted it to their children, and packed theaters for its 40th anniversary re-release? They got it exactly right.

Who's the master?

The audience. Always the audience.
