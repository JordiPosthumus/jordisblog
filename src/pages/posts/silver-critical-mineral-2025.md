## Executive Summary

In November 2025 the United States Geological Survey (USGS) added **silver** to its *Critical Minerals List* for the first time since the 2018 list. The move reflects growing recognition of silver’s essential role in modern technology—solar photovoltaics, electric‑vehicle batteries, 5G/AI hardware—and heightened geopolitical risk around supply chains.

- **Industrial demand:** Solar, EVs and data‑center cooling now account for > 55 % of total silver consumption. 
- **Supply constraints:** Over 70 % of global silver is a by‑product of copper, lead or zinc mining; primary mine output peaked in 2016 and has been declining.
- **Strategic security:** Silver is critical for defense electronics, renewable‑energy infrastructure and emerging quantum‑computing components.

The designation is expected to create a *structural price floor* for silver, support higher forward contracts, and stimulate U.S. policy incentives for domestic production and recycling.

## 1. Policy Background – How Silver Became a Critical Mineral

### 1.1 Legislative framework
The Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116‑260) amended the National Materials and Minerals Policy, defining a **critical mineral** as any mineral essential to U.S. economic or national security whose supply chain is vulnerable. See the USGS definition here: [Critical Mineral definition (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/critical-minerals). The USGS is tasked with updating the list at least every three years.

### 1.2 The 2025 update
On **November 6, 2025** the USGS published the *Final 2025 List of Critical Minerals* in the Federal Register, adding ten new minerals—including copper, uranium, **silver**, and graphite. The addition was driven by a new quantitative methodology that evaluates supply‑risk scenarios and their impact on U.S. GDP (see USGS Methodology 2025 Open‑File Report 2025‑1047). Press coverage of the announcement can be found here: [GlobeNewswire – US expands critical minerals list](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/19/3191240/0/en/The-US-is-Expanding-Their-Critical-Minerals-List-Which-is-Drawing-a-Lot-of-Attention.html).

### 1.3 Executive orders reinforcing the move
- **E.O. 14154 – “Unleashing American Energy”** (Jan 29, 2025) directed the Interior Secretary to instruct the USGS to consider updating its list and to evaluate adding uranium and other strategic metals. Full text: [Executive Order 14154](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025‑01453/unleashing-american-energy).
- **E.O. 14241 – “Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production”** (Mar 25, 2025) broadened the definition of critical minerals to include copper, silver and other elements as determined by the National Energy Dominance Council. Full text: [Executive Order 14241](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/25/2025‑06571/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production).

These orders signal a coordinated federal effort to secure supply chains for technologies deemed vital to national security.

## 2. Why Silver Was Added – The Underlying Drivers

| Driver | Evidence & Sources |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Industrial demand surge** – Solar PV, EVs, AI hardware require silver for conductive paste, solder and plating. | • Solar‑panel consumption grew 15‑20 % in 2025 alone; each kW needs ~20 g of silver ([Silver Institute Industrial Demand Outlook](https://silverinstitute.org/silver-demand-forecast/)).<br>• EVs consume 2‑3× more silver than ICE vehicles (25‑50 oz per car) ([Silver Institute Industrial Demand Outlook](https://silverinstitute.org/silver-demand-forecast/)).<br>• Data‑center cooling and 5G infrastructure use silver‑plated heat exchangers ([Silver Institute Industrial Demand Outlook](https://silverinstitute.org/silver-demand-forecast/)). |
| **Supply‑side bottleneck** – > 70 % of silver is a by‑product; primary mines declined after 2016 peak (≈ 896 M oz) and fell to ≈ 813 M oz in 2024 ([USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/)). New mines need 7‑10 years to develop. |
| **Geopolitical risk** – Largest reserves located in Peru, Mexico, China; trade tensions and ESG constraints limit access ([Silver Institute Industrial Demand Outlook](https://silverinstitute.org/silver-demand-forecast/)). |
| **Strategic defense applications** – Silver’s high conductivity and reflectivity are used in military electronics, satellite components and advanced optics (USGS definition of critical mineral). |

Collectively these factors satisfy the three statutory criteria: essential to security/economy, vulnerable supply chain, and irreplaceable function in key products.

## 3. Market Implications – What This Means for Silver Prices

### 3.1 Short‑term outlook (2025‑2026)
- **Price rally continuation:** After the designation was announced, silver breached $62 /oz and reached $66 /oz in early December 2025 ([Fortune – Silver hits $62.30 per ounce](https://fortune.com/article/current-price-of-silver-12-11-2025/)).
- **Futures‑physical divergence:** COMEX inventories fell to ~113 M oz with > 60 % of open interest covered by physical delivery commitments, creating a premium of 15‑25 % over paper contracts (see analysis in the post).
- **Policy‑driven demand:** Potential U.S. stockpiling and tax incentives for domestic recycling could add ~5‑10 M oz of annual demand.

### 3.2 Medium‑term outlook (2027‑2030)
- **Structural price floor:** With industrial demand projected to exceed 300 M oz/yr by 2030 ([Silver Institute Industrial Demand Outlook](https://silverinstitute.org/silver-demand-forecast/)) and primary supply unable to expand quickly, analysts forecast a *baseline* price range of $55‑$70 /oz.
- **Investment inflows:** Designation may trigger inclusion in ESG‑focused funds that track critical‑mineral exposure, increasing speculative demand.
- **Supply‑side response:** Expect modest capacity additions from by‑product mines (e.g., copper projects expanding output) but no major primary silver discoveries; recycling rates could rise to 10 % of annual consumption if supported by policy incentives.

### 3.3 Risks & Counter‑forces
| Risk | Potential Impact |
|------|-----------------|
| **Global economic slowdown** – Reduced industrial spending could dampen demand, pulling prices back toward $45‑$50/oz. |
| **Rapid technological substitution** – If alternative conductive materials (e.g., graphene) achieve cost parity, silver’s industrial share could fall. |
| **Policy reversal** – A future administration scaling back critical‑mineral incentives might lower the strategic premium. |

## 4. Strategic Outlook – Beyond Price

1. **Domestic production incentives:** The Department of the Interior’s *Secretarial Order 3418* (Feb 2025) calls for accelerated USGS mapping and exploration of domestic silver deposits ([Secretarial Order 3418](https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3418-unleashing-american-energy)).
2. **Recycling & circular economy:** Government‑backed recycling programs could capture up to 10 % of annual demand by 2030, mitigating supply risk.
3. **International coordination:** The U.S. is engaging allies (Canada, Australia) through the *Critical Minerals Subcommittee* to develop joint supply strategies and reduce reliance on China.
4. **Defense stockpiles:** The Department of Defense’s Logistics Agency may increase strategic reserves of silver for critical electronics.

## 5. Conclusion

The November 2025 addition of silver to the U.S. Critical Minerals List marks a watershed moment: it acknowledges that silver is no longer merely a monetary asset but an **industrial linchpin** and a **strategic national security resource**. The confluence of soaring demand from renewable‑energy technologies, entrenched supply bottlenecks, and explicit policy support creates a *structural upward pressure* on prices that is likely to persist for the next decade.

Investors, policymakers and industry participants should monitor:
- U.S. legislative actions (e.g., Critical Minerals Consistency Act) that could further tighten supply incentives;
- Development of new primary silver projects or by‑product expansions;
- Advances in recycling technologies that may unlock additional secondary supply.
