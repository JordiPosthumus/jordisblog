## Content Themes & Core Focus Areas

The blog covers these seven primary themes:

### 1. Physical vs Paper Market Divergence
- Paper-to-physical ratios (typically 80:1 to 300:1)
- COMEX inventory depletion patterns
- Registered vs eligible inventory distinctions
- Lease rates as scarcity indicators
- Backwardation/contango signals

### 2. Supply-Demand Fundamentals
- Five consecutive years of structural deficits (2021-2025)
- Annual shortfalls: 95-149 million ounces
- Byproduct trap: 70% of silver from copper/lead/zinc mining
- Peak production: 2016 (~896M oz), declining to ~813M oz in 2024

### 3. Industrial Demand Revolution
- Solar PV: ~20g silver per kilowatt, 15-20% growth in 2025
- Electric Vehicles: 25-50 oz per EV (vs. 1-2 oz for ICE vehicles)
- AI/Data Centers: Silver-plated heat exchangers, 5G infrastructure
- Industrial demand >55-60% of total consumption

### 4. Geopolitical & Policy Factors
- USGS Critical Minerals designation (Nov 2025)
- China export restrictions and state-trading requirements
- Commerce Department critical minerals probe (de facto export restrictions)
- Executive Orders on strategic mineral production

### 5. Market Mechanics & Technical Indicators
- Coverage ratios: (physical coverage ÷ open interest)
- Futures-physical divergence premiums (15-25% over spot typical)
- CFTC Commitment of Traders data interpretation
- ETF holdings vs physical inventories

### 6. Market Structure Analysis
- COMEX vs LBMA vs Shanghai Gold Exchange dynamics
- Delivery constraints and arbitrage breakdowns
- Short position analysis (naked short selling focus)

### 7. Historical Context
